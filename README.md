## Overview
The project explores a classic problem in the field of machine learning and data analysisâ€”predicting salaries based on factors like age, education, occupation, and more. We utilize logistic regression and Naive Bayes classifiers to model and predict salary classes.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following fields:

- age: The age of the individual.
- workclass: The type of employment of the individual (e.g., Private, Self-emp).
- education: Highest level of education achieved.
- educationno: Highest level of education in numerical form.
- maritalstatus: Marital status of the individual.
- occupation: Job occupation.
- relationship: Relationship status.
- race: Race of the individual.
- sex: Gender of the individual.
- capitalgain: Monetary capital gains.
- capitalloss: Monetary capital losses.
- hoursperweek: Number of hours worked per week.
- native: Native country.
- Salary: Salary class (<=50K or >50K).

## Data files:
- SalaryData_Train.csv: Training data containing 30,161 entries.
- SalaryData_Test.csv: Test data containing 15,060 entries.

## Library Usage
The project uses several libraries:

- Pandas and NumPy for data handling.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
- Scikit-learn for modeling and predictions.
- Statsmodels for more statistical approaches in Python.
- Category Encoders for handling categorical variables.
